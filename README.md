# Network Agency Site

Network is my second project where I followed a design and completed all the implementation on my own. It is an agency website project created to practice and demonstrate my skills as a front-end developer based on a Figma [design](https://uihut.com/all/digital-agency-landing-page-design/25152) from [UIHUT](https://uihut.com). The original design was done for 1440p width screens, and although it has been adapted to 1920p width, there might be some inconsistencies.

The live site is deployed on [Netlify](https://networkagency-leomat.netlify.app/).

## Features

- Interactive carousels and accordions
